== 2.1 Futures 

* A Future is a wrapper for delayed values
* Creating a future does not block computation, calling `Future.get` will block until the Future is complete
* `Future.get` is like a join which also wraps the value
* Can rewrite `ASUM` using futures like so:

[source,java]
----
FSUM1 = FUTURE {LOWER}
FSUM2 = FUTURE {UPPER}
SUM = FSUM1.get() + FSUM2.get()
----

* Futures are particularly useful in the context of pure functions: no side effects reduces the complexity of the program
* Futures also allow a wider set of programs than async, finish

== 2.2 Futures in Fork Join

* To see Futures in action, consider the following ASUM example:

[source,java]
----
class ASUM extends RecursiveTask
{
	ARR, LO, HI

	compute()
	{
		if (LO > HI) return 0;
		else if (LO == HI) return ARR[LO];
		else
		{
			MID = (LO + HI)/2;
			L = new ASUM(ARR, LO, MID);
			R = new ASUM(ARR, MID + 1, HI);
			R.fork() // Kick off future
			return L.compute() + R.join();
		}
	}
}
----

== 2.3 Memoization and Parallelism

* Memoization is the process of storing input/output maps
* This fits into futures by storing the future itself into a data structure
* Pascal's triangle is a good example problem for this technique

== 2.4 Streams

* Java Streams provide an alternate way of working with collections
* Usually employ higher order functions in map/foreach type applications
* Built into streams is first class support for parallelism via parallel stream

== 2.5 Data Races and Determinism

* *Functional Determinism:* same input guarantees the same output
* *Structural Determinism:* same input guarantees the same computational graph
* Preferably programs would exhibit both properties
* *Data Race:* data is being read/written or written/written in parallel
* Write/write means that the output is non-deterministic 
* Data Race Freedom => structural and functional determinism
* *Benign Non-Determinism:* different outputs/graph but all outputs are acceptable
* Example: string search may find multiple acceptable indices
